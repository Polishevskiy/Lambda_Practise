# Lambda_Practise
Lambda expression in Java is a way to create an anonymous function, which can be passed around as a variable or a parameter to a method. It allows for a concise way to write functional interfaces, which are interfaces with only one abstract method.

Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 and have been a powerful addition to the language, especially in the context of functional programming. The syntax of a lambda expression is as follows:

(parameter_list) -> expression

or

(parameter_list) -> { statements; }

The parameter list specifies the input parameters for the lambda expression, and the arrow -> separates the parameter list from the expression or statement block. If the expression is a single expression, then it can be written without curly braces. However, if the expression is a block of statements, then it must be enclosed in curly braces.

Lambda expressions can be used to implement functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method. For example, the java.util.function package provides many functional interfaces, such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier, which can be used with lambda expressions to create concise and readable code.

Overall, lambda expressions provide a powerful tool for writing more concise and expressive code in Java. They can be used to create anonymous functions, which can be passed around as variables or parameters, and they can be used to implement functional interfaces in a concise and readable way.
